## Building Your Own Python Learning App

The app's purpose is to quiz que user with Python questions, determine if the user gets them right or wrong and finally calcualte and save the final score.
Here's how the app should work. When running it, the user is shown a table with all the topics, the number of questions available in each topic,
and the most recent score:

Let's say the user inputs "2". This would take take them to the quiz on Lists and start prompting the questions on that topic.

Whenever the user enters an invalid input, they are prompted over and over until they enter a valid question or enter "q" to quit.

When they get the right answer, the program prints a message to the user saying they got it right.

Whenever the user enters the wrong answer, the app lets them know as well.

Once they finish answering all questions, the app prints the final score for that run and saves it in a file for future reference.
